# Impossible-Transport

Place an engine and some wheels. Connect them with metal frames. Hook up a chain to the engine and a wheel to power it. Build a basket type thing with the frames and carry some coconuts to the end of the level.
The code is a horrifying mess. The game is kinda buggy and fun. And very incomplete, it's just one level.

The lessons I learned:
- Physic simulations are finicky when high speeds are involved.
- There is a limit to how hacky and messy one can code without constantly cringing. 
- Level design is not very fun.
